# game-of-greed

**Author**: Richard von Hagel
**Version**: 1.0.1 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This application is a simple version of the Game of Greed (AKA Farkle) where players roll up to six dice.  After rolling, the player can set aside scoring dice and then decide to either "bank" the score or roll again.  If a subsequent roll does not score any points, all points earned are forfeited.  The objective is to reach a score of 10000.

## Getting Started

Python
import random

## API
None
